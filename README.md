Game of Life
=====
This is a jQuery based version of the classic Conway's Game of Life algorithm.
Usage:
Open the index file. It is initially in edit mode and all squares are "dead"; red squares are "dead" green squares are "alive".
Click a tile to change its type (and consequently its color). When you are ready to step through the sequence, click the "Edit" button.
The background will black out, and now "dead" cells are black while "live" cells are white. Click the "Step" button to your hearts content
to see the effect of the GOL algorithm on your configuration. Enjoy!
